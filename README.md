# Applied Linear Statistical Models


This project explores the application of multiple linear regression (MLR) using R to predict Uber fare prices, focusing on advanced statistical modeling techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression diagnostics. The work demonstrates expertise in R programming for data analysis, feature engineering, and model optimization, aiming to derive actionable insights for business applications.

## Key Features of the Project  

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering  
- Utilized R for comprehensive EDA, including visualizing relationships between fare prices and key predictors like distance, time, and location.  
- Created engineered features such as:
  - **`distance_daytime_interaction`**: Captures the combined effect of trip distance and time of day on fare prices.  
  - **`pickup_clusters` and `dropoff_clusters`**: Applied K-means clustering to group geographic locations, uncovering fare concentration patterns.  
- Analyzed and visualized the effects of time variables (year, month, and hour) and passenger count on fare prices, providing deeper context for regression analysis.  

### 2. Linear Regression Implementation and Optimization  
- Built a multiple linear regression model in R to predict Uber fares, incorporating both original and engineered features.  
- Enhanced model performance by:
  - Applying **stepwise regression** to reduce complexity while retaining predictive accuracy.  
  - Achieving a high RÂ² value of **0.7646**, indicating strong explanatory power for fare variation.  
- Conducted variable selection based on statistical significance (p-values) and multicollinearity checks using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).  

### 3. Diagnostics and Remedial Measures  
- Verified regression assumptions (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality) using R diagnostic tools:
  - Residual plots, QQ-plots, and Durbin-Watson tests for independence.  
  - Breusch-Pagan test for homoscedasticity and VIF checks for multicollinearity.  
- Addressed issues such as:  
  - **High leverage points**: Removed influential data points to improve model stability.  
  - **Normality deviation**: Applied log transformation to the response variable (`fare_amount`) to correct skewed distributions.

## Project Results  
- The optimized model explains **76.46% of the variation** in Uber fare prices, demonstrating the efficacy of feature engineering and diagnostics in improving regression models.  
- **Key findings**:  
  - Trip distance is the most significant predictor of fare prices.  
  - Fares exhibit geographic clustering, with specific pickup and drop-off locations linked to higher fares.  
  - Time variables (year, month, and daytime) significantly influence pricing, highlighting seasonal and temporal trends.

## Insights and Applications  
### For Users:  
- Gain a better understanding of Uber's pricing rules to make cost-effective travel decisions, such as optimizing pickup/drop-off locations and ride times.  

### For Uber:  
- Leverage predictive insights to refine pricing strategies, optimize fleet allocation, and improve revenue forecasting by targeting high-demand times and locations.
